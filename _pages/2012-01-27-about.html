<p style="padding-top: 2em;">I am an enthusiastic web designer and front-end developer. I work at <a href="http://www.monki.com" target="_blank">Monki</a> in Stockholm and I like to make stuff with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<h3 style="clear: both;">About this site</h3>
<p>This site was originally called Jamie Robertson Innit but was deemed to be too facetious. I remade everything in late 2013. The portfolio area slider below is built from scratch with some simple jQuery functions. It uses hardware accelerated css transforms and transitions, and on older browsers it falls back to using css positioning and transitions, and on <em>even older</em> browsers it uses regular jQuery animations. I also try to keep the slider in its last position by using a session cookie.</p>
<p>The icons in the navigation area are animated with css keyframe animations. If the browser doesn't support css keyframe animations, it will fallback to using the <a href="http://spritely.net/" target="_blank">Spritely library</a> to display animated javascript sprites.</p>
<p><em>If you like anything on my site please feel free to take a look at the source code or ask me a question about it.</em></p>
<h3>Qualifications / Education:</h3>
<p><em>Degree:</em> The University of Edinburgh <br />
<a href="http://www.eca.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Edinburgh College of Art</a> <br />
'Visual Communication' (B.A. Hons.)</p>
<h3>My favourite resources</h3>
<p>My most frequented resource is of course <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> due to its overwhelming wealth of information. I am also a keen follower of blogs like <a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a>, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS Tricks</a>, and most recently, the <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops" target="_blank">Codrops</a> blog by Tympanus.</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>The headers on this site are set in Lato, <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato" target="_blank">which is available from Google web fonts.</a> I use it in three weights and also make use of letter spacing and border-bottoms (not text-decoration underlines) to sex it up.</p>
