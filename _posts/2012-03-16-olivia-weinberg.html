<p>I designed this fully personalized Wordpress theme for an art journalist. I wanted to keep the design simple and elegant so as to keep the focus on the writing and images. There are quirky touches with the menu icons and footer background, which is supposed to look like the floor of an art gallery. Visit the site at www.oliviaweinberg.com.</p>
<h3>Details from the site:</h3>

<h3>Holding page / Welcome page:</h3>
<p>I also made an interactive holding page while I was working on the site. The initials OW were created with dots which changed colour when you rolled over them. It was so much fun that I was asked if it could be made into a welcome page. The original was made in Adobe Flash but then I made it again with jQuery. <strong><a href="http://www.jamierobertsoninteractive.com/OW/" target="_blank">View the holding page here.</a></strong></p>

<h3>Potential Logotypes:</h3>
<p>I experimented with many versions of the OW logotype, having fun with styles that evoked famous artists and art institutions.</p>
