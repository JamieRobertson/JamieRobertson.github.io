<p>Between October and November I was lucky enough to be given a month long internship at <a title="see the Realise digital agency website" href="http://www.realise.com/" target="_blank">'Realise' digital agency</a> in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>I worked on live projects for a variety of clients. I was creating client sites, doing competitor analysis concerning social networking, creating avatars and other icons, producing short augmented realities with After Effects and making Flash adverts.</p>
<p>The experience taught me a lot about working in a professional atmosphere, like the fast pace of production and edits.</p>
<p>I also learnt how to use flash tracking technologies like <strong>MediaMind</strong> (Eyeblaster) and <strong>DoubleClick</strong>, and about using Flash plugins such as <strong>greenSock</strong>, to speed up the creation of ads.</p>
<p>Here are some Flash adverts I created during the internship (click to play):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jamierobertsoninteractive.com/realise/lloyds_ads.html" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-267" title="see these flash ads (opens in new window/tab)" src="assets/lloyds_ads.jpg" alt="" width="579" height="565" /></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>I also made a range of accountancy-themed avatars. The slideshow below shows a few of the ideas I tested out before arriving on the most suitable solution.</p>

<p>I was also asked to think of concepts for an <a href="http://www.aurasma.com/" target="_blank">aurasma</a>. Aurasma is an augmented reality platform. When you see a print advert like the one below, you could hover your smart phone or tablet over the advert and once the device recognizes the image, it would play a short video commercial, possibly with a link at the end to find out more.</p>
<p>I used <strong>Adobe After Effects</strong> to create the short mock-up below, it was the third or fourth time I had used After Effects and really enjoyed the software, I hope I can use it much more in the future. (note: this work is draft quality, was done on spec and should be treated as a prototype).</p>
