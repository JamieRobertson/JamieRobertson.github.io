<p>I was commissioned by <a href="http://www.dotwebdesign.co.uk" target="blank">Dot Web Design</a> to work with <a href="http://api.gettyimages.com/" target="_blank">Getty Images' API, called <em>Connect</em></a>. My brief was to design and develop an image search interface for an ecommerce site that sells printed canvas wall panels.</p>
<p>The brief was to make it work like this:<br />
<br />1. The user types in a word or phrase and relevant images appear,<br />
<br />2. The user chooses their favourite image and selects the right size,<br />
<br />3. The user adds the item to the shopping cart and repeats the process until satisfied, then goes to the checkout.</p>
<h3>How it was made</h3>
<p>I used jQuery for DOM manipulation and to store the input values. The data was then sent using JSON to a pHp script that used the Zend Framework to handle the api call.</p>
<p>Working with the API was challenging because at the time it was quite new and so had a small user community. However Getty does provide quite good documentation and now has a good forum on its api site.</p>
<h3>Http Requests with the Zend Framework (v2)</h3>
<p>I started by trying to everything in jQuery and JSON, but eventually got stuck when it came to making the http post requests.</p>
<p>In order to make http post requests successfully without falling foul of the same-origin security issues, Getty recommends using the Zend framework. This was my first time using the Zend framework and initially found it quite intimidating due to its overwhelming size. After a few headaches I finally decided that the best approach was to use just the Zend components that I needed.</p>
<p><em>If anyone is reading this and is having similar problems, please drop me an email and I will send the code I used. Hopefully it will save you a lot of time.</em></p>
