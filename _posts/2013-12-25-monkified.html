<h2>Jamie â™¡ Monki</h2>
<p>From April 2013 until January 2014 I was employed to do Graphic Design and Final Art for <a href="http://www.monki.com" target="_blank">Monki</a> in Stockholm. The position I filled was free because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave" target="_blank">pappaledighet</a>.</p>
<p>Monki is a storytelling fashion retail brand for young women.<br />
My role at Monki included:</p>
<ul>
<li>- Doing artwork for their seasonal campaigns, and promotional material</li>
<li>- Re-designing the labels - producing conceptual and technical artworks</li>
<li>- Designing and doing front-end development work for an internal website</li>
<li>- Doing front-end development work for their <a href="http://www.monki.com/Monki_World" target="_blank">MonkiSaga campaign</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to see a selection of the work I produced while at Monki please <a href="http://www.jamierobertsoninteractive.com/contact" target="_blank">contact me on this page</a>.</p>
